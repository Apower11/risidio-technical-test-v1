My approach and methodology to this product:

The way I completed this project was by completing one main component
at a time.

For example, I focused on the navbar first. Within that Navbar, I first focused
on implementing the links and dropdown link. Then I focused on making the mobile
navbar to make it fully responsive.

Then, once the Navbar was done I focused on the collections page layout. I did
HomeSection1.vue first of all to have the banner, artist avatar, name, descriptions
of the collection and the key numbers. Then I focused on making sure it was mobile
responsive and responsive on any device.

Then, I designed a single NFTItem box. Then, once I completed that design and
made it mobile responsive I began to input data for more NFTs so more of these item
boxes would be created. I displayed them in grid format and made sure they were 
responsive on any device.

Then I implemented the second Home Section called HomeSection2.vue which 
included a message saying that the user has seen the collection and has 2
buttons one for gallery and one for go back to the top. Both will take
you back to the top of the page. Then, I focused on making it responsive
on any device.

Then, I tested my project thoroughly and made sure everything worked and
I added some finishing touches like introducing a transition for the mobile navbar.

Then, I commented my code explaining it and cleaned up my code while
I was doing it.

While I was adding some finishing touches and getting towards the end of the project,
I made consistent pushes to Github in case any of the changes afterwards went wrong and
I wanted to go back to a previous version. It also helped in keeping track of the
progress of my project.

Then, once I was happy with what I had, I pushed that to Github and finished the project.
